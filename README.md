Who Wants to Be...
==================

Minimal HTML+JS interface for wannabe game show hosts.

Setup
-----

Edit `questions`, et voil√†. You can probably guess the format (hint: the first column is "difficulty").

Playing
-------

You can use keyboard shortcuts, or click on the little links below the game view.
First letter of the action is usually bound to the action.
The exception is the "50-50" action, which is attached to the letter "f". 
Actually that isn't really an exception, when you think about it.

Demo
----

There may or may not be a demo at [http://psuter.net/whowantstobe/](http://psuter.net/whowantstobe/).
